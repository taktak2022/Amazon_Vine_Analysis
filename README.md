# Module 16: BIG DATA (CLOUD COMPUTING)

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this module was to explain in detail what BIG DATA is, what constitutes Big Data, it's infrastructure as it pertains to Big Data ecosystems such as Google COLAB and Amazon Web Services (AWS) and how it may be the future of data science industries.  It was a re-introduction of sorts as we all use or heard of the term "The Cloud" as it pertains to computing but as ethereal as an actual cloud in the sky, most people do not have a clear understanding of it.  By using Spark, Hadoop and learning NLP: Natural Language Processing, we get a clearer understanding of this concept's implementation.


### TOOLS
* SPARK
  * MapReduce
  * PySpark
* Google COLABATORY
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)

### RESULTS
NOTE: Of the 50 Datasets choices, I decided to choose "JEWELRY" due to my past experience from working at Tiffany & Co. in Hawaii and California.

## SUMMARY
Amazon's VINE program is an invitation-only program that takes their most trusted Amazon reviewers to post opinions about products to help their fellow customers in making informed purchase decisions.  Once invited, the reviewers (called "VINE VOICES") are also offered complimentary products from their participating selling partners to try out and review.  Amazon does not influence or modify Vine reviews, both negative and positive as long as they comply with the company's posting guidelines. As such, the Vine program invitees need not necessarily purchase items to review them.  This point needs emphasis to understand the parameters of the calculations that were made (see above).
