# Module 16: BIG DATA (CLOUD COMPUTING)

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this module was to explain in detail what BIG DATA is, what constitutes Big Data, it's infrastructure as it pertains to Big Data ecosystems such as Google COLAB and Amazon Web Services (AWS) and how it may be the future of data science industries.  It was a re-introduction of sorts as we all use or heard of the term "The Cloud" as it pertains to computing but as ethereal as an actual cloud in the sky, most people do not have a clear understanding of it.  By using Spark, Hadoop and learning NLP: Natural Language Processing, we get a clearer understanding of this concept's implementation.
